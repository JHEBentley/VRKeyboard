Thanks for downloading my VR Keyboard package.

It's very basic at the moment as I've only spent a few hours developing it so far for another project, but hopefully it will help you out with something anyway :).

In the sample scene you can drag the baton around in the scene viewer whilst running the scene, and you'll see it add characters to the UI string. Hopefully it isn't too much of a stretch to see how you can add VR controls to move the batons around by hand.

The sample scene is set up to only recieve strikes from objects with the tag "Baton", and the string has a char limit of 10. These can all be changed of course.

Find the prefabs in the prefab folder, the scripts in the scripts folder, etc. I hope you find it useful, or at least a good place to start!

Email me at james@jheb.xyz if you have any questions.

Cheers,
